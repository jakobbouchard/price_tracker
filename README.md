This app will let people track prices and get notifications on price changes
at various Canadian stores, starting with Best Buy. It is a project/experiment
I'm doing for school as part of a research course.

## Supported stores

None at the moment, the project just got started.

## Planned stores

- Best Buy Canada
- Amazon
- Newegg Canada

## Tech stuff

The app will be built using Google's Flutter Framework for its simplicity and
ease of use. It will make multi-platform development much quicker too ~~(although
I do need a Mac first).~~ I will not be making an iOS app at the moment due to
time and hardware restrictions. Part of the reason why I removed the Apple Auth
option.

For the backend, I will be using Firebase since it's pretty much an all-in-one
solution for a backend. It will enable user authentication, storage of
preferences as well as notifications via Cloud Messaging.
